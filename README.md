Lab 1 Virtual Reality.
1. WebGL is used as main library. 
2. Function applyLeftFrustum() applies view from the right eye, and function applyRightFrustum() applies view from the left eye.
3. Function drawScene() renderes plane with a sphere on it.
4. applyLeftFrustum() and applyRightFrustum() are called by clicking on the corresponding buttons below the scene.
Work examples:

In the right top corner there are parameters that can be changed (FOV, cameraX, cameraY, cameraZ, aspect ratio, znear, zfar, eye_seperation - distance between the eyes, convergence)
For example let's try to change FOV, ratio and znear and apply left and right frustum
